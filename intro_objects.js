//Objects --

//Example

const fitBitData = {
	totalSteps: 35343,
	totalMiles: 342.12,
	avgCalorieBurn: 5442,
	avgSleep: '2:14',
};

//Accessing info from the object - you just use a . (dot) and then whatever key-value pair (data) you want. This is known as the dot syntax; there are other ways of acessing data from objects

fitBitData.avgSleep; //this will return avgSleep info
