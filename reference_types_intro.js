// Into to Reference Types -  *Arrays (and objects) are stored as reference types (in the variable/in memory) rather than the actual value being stored.
// Value Type Variable - the value is stored in the variable (primitive types)
// Reference - arrays; the variable does not hold the array itself, it will point to where it is in JSâ€™s memory
